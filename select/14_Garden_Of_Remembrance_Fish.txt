He hears a voice
He tries to recognise the source and place the name
A face so familiar, the smile soft and warm
The memory evades him, his mind wanders on
Down rabbit holes
A darkened maze a place to hide and be alone
Where thoughts land like snowflakes in the palm of his hand
Swift melting moments, his tears a surprise
He tries to remember just what made him cry
With the beautiful stranger who was holding his hand
He's lost between the here and now
Somewhere that he can't be found
She's still here
Her love a ghost of memory
She'll wait for an eternity
He's still here
The empty room, moth eaten curtains
Drunken drapes hold back the light
But for solitary sunbeams, on dull chandeliers
Colourless butterflies, their fate now revealed
In silken webs, forever held within the sails of yellowed shrouds
That gather dust above the dance hall floor
The silent space
She stands alone and in her heart she hears the sound
The sweet lift of music that drew them so close
Their first dance together with a world at their feet
Not so long ago
He's lost between the here and now
Somewhere that he can't be found
She's still here
Her love a ghost of memory
She'll wait for an eternity
He's still here
They work the soil
They sow the seed, they're side by side upon the earth
Growing together, now forever apart
With a love so embracing, held in their hearts
But nothing between them, no memories shared
No recognition in his soft, pale green eyes
He's lost between the here and now
Somewhere that he can't be found
She's still here
Her love a ghost of memory
She'll wait for an eternity
He's still here
He's lost between the here and now
Somewhere that he can't be found
She's still here
Her love a ghost of memory
She'll wait for an eternity
He's still here
And they're still here

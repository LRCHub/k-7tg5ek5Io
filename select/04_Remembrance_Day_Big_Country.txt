In your fine green ware
I will walk with you tonight
In your raven hair
I will find a Summer night

Upon far flung soil
I will run you through my head
In my daily toil
All the promises are said

I know the weary can rise again
I know it all from the words you send

I will go, I will go
I will leave the firelight
I will go, I will go
For it's now the time is right

I will sing a young man's song
That you would sing
On Remembrance day
I will be the sacrifice
Bells will ring
On Remembrance Day

I must leave this land
And the hunger that is here
But the place I stand
Is the one I love so dear

Like a flower in some forest
That the world will never see
I will stand so proud
For I know what we can be

I know the weary can rise again
I know it all from the words you send

I will go, I will go
I will leave the firelight
I will go, I will go
For it's now the time is right

I will sing a young man's song
That you would sing
On Remembrance day
I will be the sacrifice
And bells will ring
On Remembrance Day

This day I will remember you
This way, I will always return
(X2)

And I will sing a young man's song...
